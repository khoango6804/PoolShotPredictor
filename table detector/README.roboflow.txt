The dataset includes 92 images.
Balls-B2Zz are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 810x506 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, upside-down
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
